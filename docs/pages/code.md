The code is separated into four groups:
* [Interface functions][i]: The primary functions through which users will interact.

* [Core functions][c]: Provide the core functionality of SALR clustering--modeling the particle dynamics and extracting the particle cluster centers.

* [Setup functions ][s]: Functions to help create the inputs to the core functions--confining force and initial particle locations.

* [Utility functions][u]: A diverse set of functions that do everything from plotting to computing centers of curvature to performing fast interpolation.
